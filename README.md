For my project, I utilized the Pokemon API in order to create a small pokedex. 

I used the AJAX method to make the call along with JQuery to code.

The goal of this project is as follows:
    1. Enter a name of a pokemon in the search bar
    2. The name with the pokemon will generate along with the image weight, and pokemon number.

MVP is met by the following:
    1. Generating
         1. Image
         2. Pokemon Name
         3. Pokemon Weight
