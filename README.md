# Pok√®dex Gallery

For my project, I utilized the Pokemon API in order to create a small pokedex. 

Technologies Used: 
 1. Javascript 
 2. Pokemon API
 3. HTML
 4. CSS
 5. JQuery



MVP is met by generating the following:
        1. Image
        2. Pokemon Name
        3. Pokemon Weight

Getting Started: 

The goal of this project is as follows:
    1. Enter a name of a pokemon in the search bar
    2. The name with the pokemon will generate along with the image weight, and pokemon number.


Future updates:
  1. Mobile Optimization
  2. Adding abilities and evolutions
  3. Build a pokedex from scratch with CSS
